# My-CV-Portfolio
This is a small site I made to showcase my curriculum vitae and current skill's and so forth.
It uses nodes' core modules so no need to intall any packages
asuming you have node installed 
just cd into directory 
and run the index.js script in your terminal
liko so:    node index
I im curently hosting it on heroku @: https://vincentcv.herokuapp.com/ Thanks to Traversy Media (youtube)
disclaimer it's still in testing.
